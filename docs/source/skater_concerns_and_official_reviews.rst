Skater (coach, etc.) concerns
-----------------------------

-	If a skater has a fast question or concern between jams, help as time allows.

   -	Answering skater questions is a low priority task. If you’re busy, say so.
   -	Any question that requires more than a five word answer is probably too long.
   -	Call an official timeout as concerns warrant (ie: track damage presenting a safety hazard)

-	Don’t lose control of the conversation. As soon as a skater asks you to rehash the last jam, suggest their team seek an official review to discuss the matter.
-	If the team uses a Team Timeout, they can “buy” the head referee’s time for a minute.

   -	This is only to hear out their concern(s); it is not a free official review.


Official reviews
----------------

-	Each team receives one official review per period.

   -	This is their time to spend as they wish. It warrants your full attention and respect.
   -	If you cannot be of assistance during a review, you may be asked to return to your duties.
   -	The subject of the review must be about the prior jam, the lineup for the prior jam, or a scoring issue from two jams prior updated on the scoreboard during the prior jam.

-	Official reviews must be requested by the Captain or Alternate

   -	They must be wearing a visible “C” or “A”.
   -	They may not be inside the penalty box or on their way to it.
   -	Successfully violating this procedure warrants a delay of game penalty to the captain.

-	Outside pack referees should skate to the inside whenever a team requests an official review.
-	Officiating issues from the prior jam should be resolved prior to the beginning of the review.
-	A team has the option of exchanging their review for a 60-second “timeout”.

   -	This may not be changed to a “normal” review once significant time has elapsed.

-	If a team’s first official review of a period results in a finding of officiating error, the team’s official review is “refunded” and may be used again. This may happen to each team once per half.
-	There is no standard practice for official reviews.

   -	Every head referee has their own style. Some are quite different from others.
   -	If you are new to working with a head referee, ask how they conduct official reviews

-	The head referee has control during an official review. Even if you believe you can solve an issue, do not interrupt the head referee or team captains.

   -	Asking a clarifying question of the team captains is usually acceptable.

-	The head referee will try to establish a consensus regarding the review.

   -	The head referee makes the final decision.
   -	The head referee notifies the team captains as to the verdict.
   -	It is good form to notify the announcers as to the nature and result of the review.

-	You will make bad calls that will be overturned.

   -	Learn from your mistakes.

-	You will make good calls that will be overturned.

   -	Sometimes the overturning is correct, sometimes it isn’t.
   -	Remember that your perspective is but one view of an event. It is not the entire truth.
   -	It is not appropriate for referees to publicly air grievances regarding official reviews.

-	Don’t let an overturned call affect your focus or professionalism.
