4.2.1 - Illegal positioning
---------------------------

● Illegal positioning penalties are for…

○ Adopting or maintaining a position in which one cannot be blocked (down, out of bounds, or out of play)
○ Destroying the pack
○ Starting the jam in an illegal starting position for their role.

● It is legal to gain an illegal position for reasons of safety.
● It is legal to maintain an illegal position because of the perception that re-entering would constitute an illegal act
● Types of illegal positioning penalties and their verbal cues.

○ “Illegal position” (the basic cue)

■ Starting the jam in a completely illegal starting position

● Exception: being blocked into an illegal position by an early hit

■ Assuming a downed position to deter an incoming block

○ “Destruction”

■ A sudden, marked, or abrupt action that destroys the pack for a reason other than normal gameplay.

● Some examples of normal gameplay

○ Passing the star
○ Initiating or continuing a block
○ Returning to the track, engagement zone, and/or an upright position
○ Receiving a block
○ Accidentally falling down or out of bounds
○ At jam start, all of a team’s skaters immediately and rapidly skate (in either direction) until the pack is destroyed

● Clockwise movement is held to a higher standard than counterclockwise movement.  It does not have to be sudden, marked, or abrupt.
● Pack destructions without impact are not penalized (“No pa--pack!”)
● (rare) Both teams can destroy the pack at the same time.  One penalty should be issued to the most responsible skater on each team.
● Jammers can never receive a destruction penalty.

○ “Skating out of bounds”

■ Exiting the track without a legal reason or the belief one has a legal reason

● Some legal reasons (there are many more than this)

○ Going out of bounds as a result a missed block or receiving a block
○ Exiting the track during the jam call-off whistles
○ Exiting the track to retrieve an out-of-bounds helmet cover
○ Exiting the track following a failed apex jump
○ Falling out of bounds by accident

■ Maintaining or increasing speed while out of bounds

● Exception: accelerating to re-enter the track
● Exception: accelerating to reach the penalty box

○ “Failure to reform”

■ After a warning, failing to act to reform the pack

● Penalty goes to the most responsible skater per team.

■ See lesson 25 (“No pack situations”)

○ “Failure to return”

■ After a warning, failing to return to the engagement zone

● Penalty goes to all offending skaters
● Standing in place is considered returning so long as the pack is approaching the skater.
● An out of play (front) blocker must skate clockwise if the pack is stopped or moving clockwise.

○ This is the only situation in the entire game when a skater must skate clockwise.
○ “Failure to yield”

■ After a warning, failing to yield after starting the jam while touching a illegal starting area for one’s role (ex; jammer touching past the jammer line)

● (rare) A warning is not necessary to issue a “failure to ____” penalty if the skater cannot reasonably believe they are legally positioned and/or cannot return to a legal position.

○ Example: a skater returns from the penalty box across the track from the engagement zone.  Instead of returning to the engagement zone, the skater then engages a jammer.


4.2.4 - Other illegal procedures
--------------------------------

● Technical infractions with significant impact, if not necessarily conferring an advantage to a specific team or skater
● When possible technical infractions should be resolved before they impact the game
● Types of illegal procedures and their verbal cues.

○ “Illegal procedure”

■ Removing safety gear other than a mouthguard while in the penalty box
■ Leaving the penalty box before one’s time is expired

● Exception: when permitted to leave by an official
● Improper use of safety gear, skates, uniform, or jewelry

■ Illegally controlling a helmet cover
■ Careless actions (ex; throwing a water bottle to another skater) that threaten the safety of an official, but do not forcibly contact them.
■ A captain or alternate successfully requesting a timeout or official review while not wearing the C or A

○ “Star pass violation”

■ Illegally passing the star

○ “Pass interference”

■ Preventing a star pass via an illegal action

● Verbal cues

○ “Illegal procedure”, or

■ “Star pass violation”
■ “Pass interference”
