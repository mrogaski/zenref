4.3 - Unsporting Conduct
------------------------

● This penalty type involves significant officiating discretion, and is not limited to actions listed on this handout.
● Unsporting conduct penalties can be elevated to expulsion for egregious or repeated offenses depending on the context.
● Unsporting conduct penalties and their verbal cues

○ “Misconduct” (basic cue) - Undermining the legitimacy of the sport or displaying a lack of respect for the sport, its execution, or those that contribute to it.

■ Abusive or obscene language or gestures directed at a non-official

● (no call or warning) Minor slights inaudible to the audience addressed to a teammate or opponent
● (expulsion) Long strings of profanity or losing one’s temper

■ Impersonating an official
■ Hiding an active helmet cover during a jam
■ Reckless or negligent penalty box entry
■ Attempting to deceive a referee into issuing a penalty
■ Blocking outside the acceptable range of the sport

● Positional blocking preventing a downed skater from standing
● Blocking while airborne

○ Non-forceful / unintentional contact with significant impact
○ Intentional contact regardless of impact

● (expulsion) Intentionally falling on a prone or down skater
● (expulsion) Pulling a helmet cover off an opponent

■ Failing to abide by governing body policies during the game

● Example: fielding too many team staff

■ Intentionally blocking a skater into a downed skater
■ An ejected skater that interferes with subsequent gameplay

● Penalty to captain, skater is banished to the locker room

■ (expulsion) Intentional, reasonably avoidable, and forceful contact to an official

○ “Insubordination” - Willfully or neglectfully failing to comply with the instructions of an official, or wrongful or improper behavior motivated by intentional disregard for the rules.

■ Abusive or obscene language or gestures directed at an official

● Not every slight warrants a penalty

■ Willfully failing to follow the instructions of an official

● This includes immediately leaving the track in response to a penalty

○ A skater must exit the track relative to where they were issued the penalty.
○ A bit ahead or behind this area has no impact.
○ A lot ahead or behind has impact.
○ Exiting is also subject to having a safe and legal opportunity to exit the track.

■ Failure to leave the track after repeatedly being directed to do so
