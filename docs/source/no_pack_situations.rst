Failure to reform
-----------------

● An illegal action whereby a blocker does not attempt to reform a pack
● All actions to reform the pack must be done immediately

○ Leisurely reforming is insufficient

● No penalties are issued if the pack immediately reforms
● Blockers who are directed to the penalty box cannot reform the pack
● Blockers in the back group must cease blocking and skate forward
● Blockers in the front group must cease blocking and brake to a halt

○ Blockers in the front group are not required to skate clockwise, but may do so.

● Blockers in a middle group (if any) may either stop or skate forward

○ The entire group need not perform the same action

● Out of bounds blockers who can legally re-enter must do so if reentering would help to reform the pack.
● Skaters in a position that prevents an opposing blocker from directly returning in bounds (i.e.; the opponent will receive a cut if they reenter) must skate forward until the skater may re-enter.
● Penalties go to the most responsible person (if any) in either group that fails to reform

○ Priority goes to a blocker who initiates a new block or continues an existing one

■ This includes positional blocks

○ Next priority goes to the blocker closest to the other group who fails to reform

■ This could also be a blocker who fails to move forward allowing an out of bounds skater to return to the track without skating clockwise

○ When skaters are equally responsible the penalty goes to the closest blocker

● A penalty should be issued to the most responsible blocker per team who fails to reform
● Sustained failure to reform warrants additional penalties


No pack situation handling
--------------------------

● “No pack” is announced.

○ The Rear IPR typically does this. Front IPR less often. On rare occasion an OPR.

● Destruction penalties are issued (if applicable)

○ These are typically issued by the referee who announced “no pack”
○ If a pack will reform quickly the destruction penalty is sometimes delayed until the pack reforms

● The front IPR issues failure to reform penalties to the front group as warranted
● The rear IPR issues failure to reform penalties to the rear group as warranted
● OPRs watch for blocks that cause an opponent to fall or go out of bounds
● If an immediate failure to reform penalty was issued and the pack is not yet reformed, an IPR re-calls out “No pack!”

○ Some referees consider this optional while others maintain this is good practice

● Repeat this process until the pack reforms
● “Pack” or “Pack is here” is announced when the pack is reestablished.
