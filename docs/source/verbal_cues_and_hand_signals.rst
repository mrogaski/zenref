The basics
----------

- All penalties are issued using the following format:
  
   - (whistle) + team color + skater number “spelled out” + penalty (cue and hand signal) + report to the box hand signal
     
- Verbal cues (especially penalties) fall into three tiers called stars (one star, two star, etc.). They roughly correspond to basic, intermediate, and advanced cues.
  
   - One-star cues sometimes lack specificity but are appropriate for the beginning official.
   - Two-star cues are standardized cues that provide additional information that replace one-star basic cues in certain situations. They are appropriate for experienced officials.
     
   - Three-star cues are non-standardized and should be used as used as necessary to provide additional context. Advanced officials are expected to use these.
     
   - Example:
     
      - One star: “Gold one zero, illegal procedure”
      - Two stars: “Gold one zero, star pass violation”
      - Three stars: “Gold one zero, star pass violation, report as the jammer”
	
- Call loudly, clearly, and repeat hand signals as necessary (especially on the outside)

Hand signals
------------

- Referees must know all hand signals
  
   - Expressively -- the ability to perform them correctly for others
   - Receptively -- the ability to recognize hand signals by others
     
- This is an appropriate time for referee trainees to learn standardized hand signals as well as hand signals used by the local officiating community.
