Unsporting conduct penalties

   -	Insubordination

      -	Profane, abusive, or obscene language or gestures directed at an official
      -	Willful or neglectful failure to obey the instructions of an official

-	This is most commonly failing to leave the track after a penalty


Hierarchy of calls
------------------

-	Sometimes an action warrants a penalty for multiple reasons

   -	Example: leg-to-leg contact that forces an opponent down

      -	Could be a low block or could be a leg block

-	When an action warrants a penalty for violating multiple rules, the official should issue the penalty for which they feel most confident.
-	If the official feels equally confident in multiple possible calls, use this hierarchy:

   -	Misconduct (4.3)
   -	Illegal Target Zone (4.1.1)
   -	Illegal Blocking Zone (4.1.2)
   -	Illegal Contact (4.1.3)
   -	Multiplayer Block (4.1.4)
   -	Illegal Position (4.2.1)
   -	Gaining Position (4.2.2)
   -	Interference (4.2.3)
   -	Illegal Procedure (4.2.4)
