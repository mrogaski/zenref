Special thanks
--------------

The knowledgeable folks at `Zebra Huddle <www.zebrahuddle.com>`_ assisted me in peer reviewing many of the earlier handouts on referee procedures. I’d also like to thank the many readers who have taken the time to email their thoughts and observations on The Zen of Reffing Roller Derby. Finally, I’d also like to thank the WFTDA, MRDA, and JRDA and their volunteers for their tireless dedication to the sport of roller derby.
